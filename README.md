## Abstract
<b>Objectives</b> End-of-outbreak declarations are an important component of outbreak response as they indicate that public health and social interventions may be relaxed or lapsed. The present study aimed to assess end-of-outbreak probabilities for clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases during the first wave of the pandemic in Japan.

<b>Methods</b> We computed a statistical model for localized end-of-outbreak determination that accounted for the reporting delay for new cases. Four clusters representing different social contexts and time points during the epidemic were selected and their end-of-outbreak probabilities were evaluated.

<b>Results</b> The end-of-outbreak determination was most closely tied to outbreak size. Larger outbreaks (accounting for missing onsets and underascertainment of cases) tended to reach the proscribed probability thresholds for end-of-outbreak determination at later times compared to smaller outbreaks. In addition, end-of-outbreak determination was closely related to estimates of case dispersion k and the effective reproduction number R<sub>e</sub>.

<b>Conclusions</b> When public health measures are effective, lower R<sub>e</sub> (less transmission on average) and larger k (lower risk of superspreading) will be in effect and end-of-outbreak determinations can be declared with greater confidence. This application can help distinguish between local extinction and low levels of transmission, and communicating these end-of-outbreak probabilities helps inform public health decision-making around the appropriate use of resources
